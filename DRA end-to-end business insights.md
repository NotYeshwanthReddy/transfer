End-to-End Explanation of the Dynamic Risk Assessment (DRA) Project

The Dynamic Risk Assessment (DRA) tool is a reporting solution that consolidates financial risk data across various trading desks to help auditors and risk managers assess trading activities, market risks, and compliance violations. Below is a detailed breakdown of the project from business use case to implementation specifics.


---

1. Business Use Case

Why is this project needed?

Financial institutions operate trading desks dealing with multiple financial products (e.g., equities, fixed income, commodities).

Regulatory and compliance teams need a real-time risk assessment across desks to identify anomalies and optimize audits.

The existing process is manual, time-consuming, and fragmented, with auditors pulling data from different sources and reconciling it manually.


Who will use it?

Auditors & Risk Managers (Primary users)

Will use the DRA tool to generate pre-audit risk reports.

Assess key risk indicators before initiating audits.


Market Risk & Compliance Teams (Secondary users)

Will review risk exposure, breaches, and trading patterns.


Senior Management

May use summarized reports to track market risk trends.

2. Project Requirements

What are the key requirements?

Automate Risk Report Generation:

Allow users to select a trading desk and generate a risk assessment report.


Real-Time Data Fetching:

Pull the latest data from multiple internal databases & APIs.


Comprehensive Risk Metrics:

Include P&L trends, market limits, compliance violations, and operational losses.


Output in Readable Format:

Generate reports in PDF (summary) and Excel (raw data).


Performance & Scalability:

Ensure reports run within 10-15 minutes, even with large datasets.


User Access Control & Logging:

Restrict access to Markets users only.

Track who accessed which report and when.

3. How is the Requirement Addressed?

Solution Approach

1. Frontend (User Interface)

Quartz-based UI: Users select a trading desk from a drop-down menu.

Click "Generate Report" â†’ System fetches data & generates reports.

Download options for PDF (summary view) and Excel (detailed raw data).



2. Backend (Data Processing)

Fetch data from multiple databases (live API calls preferred).

Transform & aggregate data to create structured reports.

Apply filters & business rules (e.g., handling missing data, normalizing formats).

Generate reports dynamically using Python-based processing.



3. Hosting & Execution

Quartz infrastructure: Runs report generation.

Scheduled vs. Real-time updates: Some data sources refresh nightly, others update on request.

5. Implementation Details

5.1. Input: Data Sources, Database Details, and Data Processing


---

5.2. Data Transformation

Standardization: Normalize all datasets to a common timestamp & format.

Aggregation: Compute rolling averages, variance analysis, and anomalies.

Filtering: Remove inactive desks, duplicated records, and irrelevant transactions.

Formatting: Structure data into Excel tables (raw) and PDF summaries (visual trends, insights).

5.3. Output Representation

1. PDF Report (Summary)

Overview of Desk Risks

P&L Trends & Anomalies

Market Limit Breaches

Operational & Compliance Risks

Supervisory Review Findings

Legend & Explanations


2. Excel Report (Detailed Data)

Raw data tables for deeper analysis.

Drill-down capability for auditors.



---

6. User Access, Security, and Logging

Role-Based Access (RBAC)

Quartz Permissions:

Markets Users Only

Read access to Ledger, Risk, Compliance Databases.


Audit Logging:

Tracks who accessed reports, when, and what data was fetched.




---

7. Performance Considerations & Bottlenecks

Performance Issues Identified

Long Query Execution:

LMS API takes 30+ mins for market limits data.

Trade Data API fails on high-volume days.


Delayed P&L Data Refresh:

Needs a better API integration with Granite.



Solutions

Pre-fetch desk list monthly instead of daily.

Implement caching mechanisms for slow APIs (e.g., LMS, P&L).

Monitor API calls using Grafana to optimize load balancing.
